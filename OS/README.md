Paging 
It is invisible to a programmer.

In paging, the type of fragmentation is internal.
The size of the page is determined by available memory.

In this, the size of segments is not fixed.

RAID
RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is like having backup copies of your important files stored in different places on several hard drives or solid-state drives (SSDs). If one drive stops working, your data is still safe because you have other copies stored on the other drives. Itâ€™s like having a safety net to protect your files from being lost if one of your drives breaks down.
